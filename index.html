					<h3>Brigham and Women's Pathfinding Application</h3>
					<p>I worked in an agile team of nine WPI students to create a pathfinding application for Brigham and Women's hospital. This application included a pathfinding screen, multiple requests for services (such as spill cleanup and requesting a translator), and a simple room booking service. In the creation of this application, I acted both as a software engineer and the project manager, juggling the writing of features in the application while coordinating and motivating our team.</p>

					<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
					<p>I wrote this website on my own entirely in html and css. I taught myself html and css through the help of brothers in my fraternity, as I had worked under our web chair to keep up our website which you can find <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~apo/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
